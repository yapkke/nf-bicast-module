=============
 Compilation
=============
The Makefile included does two things:

1. Compiles the Netfilter bicast module.
2. Compiles the bicast helper programs for operation. change-active-slave.c requires the SIOCBONDHOOLOCK macro definition - you need to install the Hoolock-enabled bonding driver.

===========
 Operation
===========
The helper programs communicate with the Netfilter module via a device file called nfm_dev. Make sure that is present by executing:

   [sudo] mknod nfm_dev c <NF_MOBILITY_MAJOR_NUM> 0

where NF_MOBILITY_MAJOR_NUM is defined to be 240 in nf_mobility_ioctl.h.
